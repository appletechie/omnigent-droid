"""Spawn-env builder for the Droid harness.

Its own module (not ``plugin.py``) so plugin discovery stays import-light:
core resolves this lazily by the string path in ``spawn_env_builders``, and
only a session that actually selects Droid pays for the import.

Without a registered builder, core's ``_build_spawn_env_from_spec`` returns
``None`` for ``droid`` — and the per-session ``/model`` override it applies
afterwards is gated on ``env is not None``, so the picker's choice was
silently dropped before it could reach ``HARNESS_DROID_MODEL``.
